**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **David Martinez Gil**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://github.com/Bicheka/codepath-prework.git)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [x] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [X] A level counter
- [x] The SART/STOP button is green when it is SART and red when it is STOP
- [x] If any button is repeated in the pattern 2 times in a row, it is less likely that it will be repeated as the next clue
- [x] The entire page changes color to red and sound an unplecent sound when the player looses, and green with a reward song when the player wins

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[udemy.com, w3schools.com, developer.mozilla.org]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I encountered many challenges along the way. For example, finding out the best way to approach the challenge and implementing the overall logic of the game. For instance, it was hard to figurate how to do the pattern of clues, store it, and compare it with the user pattern. I ended up using arrays to store the patterns and random to make a random pattern each time the user starts over. Also, I had to fix a numerous bug. To illustrate, there was one bug that when you pressed start and press a button that was not from the pattern you would lose, but also instead of changing the STOP button to start it would skip and start automatically at level 1. Moreover, I had to tweak the duration of the animations several times to fine tune it. Another problem was that I wanted to have 9 buttons with means that I had to have 9 different sounds, and 9 different colors. Also, I had to work on the layout because of the amount of button using flex.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I am wondering how a server works. Also, how can I create a back-end for my websites? How the front-end relates with the back-end How the same backend of a website can connect to a phone app? What is the difference between websites and webapps? How to deploy a website on the internet to the public? How the copyright works for the websites? What programming language should I use for back-end?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time, I would lie to implement a timer, to make the game a little harder and complex. Also, I with more time I would change the mp3 files for sounds generated by code with the frequency of the piano notes. I would change the style as well, instead of buttons it would be piano keys, so the user has to follow the melody pattern. Furthermore, I want to improve the user interface and create a backend to save the user records or have multiples users with their records. Lastly, I would like to optimize it better for phones.]
